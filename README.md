# Humble Blog üìë

As mentioned in the description, this repository is an implementation for a blog concerned with articles and authors, allowing random thumbs up to be given to articles and basic listing/creation of both articles and authors.

Used framework is [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) along with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/).

## Description

This is a very brief README.md to provide guidance and for the reader to know his/her way through the application.

Before we proceed, here are some of references I followed in order to ensure a clean and a community-like convention:

- üì¶ [ArturKisov/nestjs-mysql-starter](https://github.com/ArturKisov/nestjs-mysql-starter)
- üì¶ [lujakob/nestjs-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/lujakob/nestjs-realworld-example-app)

### Let's Get Started

You can either use the **dockerized** version of the application or try it out in the wild.
In both cases, you will need the `.env` set inorder for this experience to be complete. You can follow the `.env.copy` to know which enviroment variables are expected.

#### üê≥ Embarking Docker

If everything is setup as it should, the application should run smoothly after the following command.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

#### üèùÔ∏è Prefering the shore

First install the dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

Then proceed with the basic launch

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Running the app

Expected functionalities and available APIs are exposed over [üì∞ here !!](http://localhost:3000/api/#/) once the application is online using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).

#### Short brief

- üñãÔ∏è **Authors**
  - [Create Author](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/AuthorController_create) - creates an author
  - [List Authors](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/AuthorController_findAll) - lists all authors
  - [Preview Author](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/AuthorController_findById) - preview an author by id
- üìÉ **Articles**
  - [Create Article](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/ArticleController_create) - creates an article
  - [List Articles](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/ArticleController_findAll) - lists all articles (use `query` to search & `byThumbsUp` to sort)
  - [Preview Article](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/ArticleController_findById) - preview an article by id
  - [Update Article](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/ArticleController_updateById) - updates a certain article by id (use `thumbsUp` boolean to give the article a kudos üëç)
- üóØÔ∏è **Comments**
  - [Post Comment](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/CommentController_create) - posts a comment to a certain article by id
  - [List Comments](http://localhost:3000/api/#/default/CommentController_findAll) - lists all comments

### Testing Functionalities

All the mentioned functionalities are tested through `*.spec` files. You may run the following command to perform a quick checkup over the APIs to ensure their functionality.

```bash
$ yarn test
```
