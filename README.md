# Humble Blog üìë

As mentioned in the description, this repository is an implementation for a blog concerned with articles and authors, allowing random thumbs up to be given to articles and basic listing/creation of both articles and authors.

Used framework is [NestJS](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) along with [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/).

## Description

This is a very brief README.md to provide guidance and for the reader to know his/her way through the application.

Before we proceed, here are some of references I followed in order to ensure a clean and a community-like convention:

- üì¶ [ArturKisov/nestjs-mysql-starter](https://github.com/ArturKisov/nestjs-mysql-starter)
- üì¶ [lujakob/nestjs-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/lujakob/nestjs-realworld-example-app)

### Setup & running the application

You can either use the **dockerized** version of the application or try it out in the wild.
In both cases, you will need the `.env` set inorder for this experience to be complete. You can follow the `.env.copy` to know which enviroment variables are expected.

#### üì∏ Clone the repository

Start-off by cloning the repository from [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

```bash
$ gh repo clone yousseftarekkh/humble-blog
```

```bash
$ cd humble-blog
```

#### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run the application

You can choose between using the `docker` way or the normal way.

##### üê≥ Embarking Docker

If everything is setup as it should, the application should run smoothly after the following command.

```bash
$ docker-compose up
```

##### üèùÔ∏è Prefering the shore

First install the dependencies

```bash
$ yarn
```

Then proceed with the basic launch

```bash
$ yarn start
```

### Inspecting the content

Expected functionalities and available APIs are exposed over [üì∞ here !!](http://localhost:3000/api/#/) once the application is online using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/).
